## Recap: ##

* Configure your git
* Create a folder and create a git repository (`git init`; the saved
  history of the folder and files) in that folder
* Create a file and track it with git (`git add`), saving it to the
  history (`git commit`)
* Write a short bio in the file
* Check what's going on in the folder (`git status`)
* Compare the file with the one in the history (`git diff`)
* Add the tracked file to the 'staging' area (`git add`; this is an
  area *before* going into the history)
* Save the file in the history (`git commit`)
* Look into your history (`git log`)
