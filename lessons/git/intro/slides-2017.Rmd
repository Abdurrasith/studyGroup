# Learning expectations

This won't even touch the surface of git... But! Hopefully, you:

- Recognize the power of using version control
- Know the basic tools to get started using git
- Where to go for help

But! No expectation to actually start using it :)


# Getting started with Git and GitHub

Installing and running Git and GitHub

## Linux
https://www.howtoforge.com/tutorial/install-git-and-github-on-ubuntu-14.04/

* Dowload and Install Git for Linux
`sudo apt-get install git`

## Windows/MacOS
https://desktop.github.com/

* Make sure you install posh-git along with GitHub

# Configuring your setup:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "you@some.domain"
```

Optional Configurations
```bash
git config --global color.ui "auto" 
```

Setup Editor for Text Files

```bash
git config --global core.editor "your_editor"
git config --list # To confirm
```

# Creating a Git Repo
* change directory (move to another folder) using 
```bash 
cd
```
* to move back one folder use
```bash 
cd ..
```
* to make a new directory
```bash
mkdir
```

# Let us create a Repo
```bash
cd ~/Documents
# for windows users with full path
cd C:/Users/user_name/Documents
# create a new folder
mkdir new_git_repo
# move to the new folder
cd new_git_repo
```
## Convert folder to **git** repo
```bash
git init
```
## check your folder to find git configuration files/folders
This folder is now a git repo (short for repository)

# Adding new files to a repo
* create a text file with
    + your name
    + program
    + research area
* save the file as `my_cred` in the git repo you just created
* add this file to the git index
```bash
git add ~/Documents/new_git_repo/my_cred
# you can also use wildcards instead of full name
git add *my_cred
```
* let us move `commit` this change to history 
```bash
git commit -m "initial commit with my info"
```

# Cloning an Existing `git` repo
We can copy or clone existing repositories from GitHub using
```bash
git clone
```
Let us do this for the UofT Coders repo available at
[UofT Coders git repo](https://github.com/UofTCoders/studyGroup)

Select the green `Clone or Download` button and select ` copy to clipboard`

In your shell/bash move to a directory of your choice and clone the repo
```bash
cd ~/Documents
# if you are using git posh (in powershell) 
# use the right click to paste the copied url
git clone https://github.com/UofTCoders/studyGroup
```

# Modify a existing file and commit changes
Go to the directory containing the example file
```bash
cd C:/Users/shyam/Documents/Courses/studyGroup/lessons/git/intro
# see all files in the directory
ls
```
Open file `example_file.md` in any text editor

To open files in bash/shell
```bash
editor_name file_name
gitpad example_file.md
```

add a new line to this starting with an asterisk(*)

save file and close

# Add changes to index and commit changes
If you have GitHub, you can add the repository you cloned/created to it and visualize the changes
