# (Very, Very Brief) Introduction to Python

 - **Authors**: Charles Zhu

 - **Lesson Topic**: Introduction to Python functionality and syntax

## Preface: ##

This is a very basic introduction to the Python programming language,
based largely off of the tutorials in the [Beginners' Guide to Python](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Programmers),
in particular the [Learn Python Tutorials](https://pythonspot.com/),
[Crash into Python](http://stephensugden.com/crash_into_python/) and
[Instant Python](http://hetland.org/writing/instant-python.html).


I tend to use only the command line and a basic text editor to do my
programming.  Quite a few integrated development environments exist,
however, including [IDLE](https://docs.python.org/2/library/idle.html) and [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/).
Madeleine recommends [WingIDE101](http://www.wingware.com/downloads/wingide-101/5.1.5-1).

## Lesson Overview: ##

Python implementations are generally interpreted (though compilers
also exist).  The interpreter that comes with python should be
accessible just by typing

    python

into the command line.  To run scripts and programs, we can instead
type

    python practice_code.py

[IPython](http://ipython.org/) is an improved interactive console
that's both easier to use and supports additional functionality.
To run IPython, type

    ipython

To run scripts and programs within ipython, type within IPython

    run practice_code.py

If you're using Python3.x rather than 2.7, use practice_code_py3.py
instead.

The lesson covers:


The [official Python documentation site](https://docs.python.org) goes into much more detail
regarding all topics covered in this code-along.  Python is supported
by a very, very extensive breadth of packages, a list can be found [here](https://pypi.python.org/pypi)
Like with git, please check out [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/python) for
 any question on it.
