# Vector Graphics vs. Rasterized (Bitmap) Graphics

In general, diagrams are usually best made in a *vector* format, while photo-realistic images or paintings are better served with *bitmaps*. A rasterisation is the conversion of a vector-graphics format to bitmap. This has to be done to display it (in editors, browsers, print, etc.), but preferably as a last step.

Features:
<table>
<tr><th></th> <th>Vector </th><th> Bitmap <th></tr>
<tr><td>data type   </td><td>shapes</td><td> pixels </td></tr>
<tr><td>stored as   </td><td>object and parameters </td><td> arrays of colours </td></tr>
<tr><td>editing   </td><td> lossless editing </td><td> loss due to rasterization (e.g. aliasing) </td></tr>
<tr><td>uses   </td><td> diagrams </td><td> photos </td></tr>
</table>
