# Vector Graphics vs. Rasterized (Bitmap) Graphics

In general, diagrams are usually best made in a *vector* format, while photo-realistic images or paintings are better served with *bitmaps*. A rasterisation is the conversion of a vector-graphics format to bitmap. This has to be done to display it (in editors, browsers, print, etc.), but preferably as a last step.

Features:
| | Vector | Bitmap |
|--:|:-----|:-------|
|data type   |shapes| pixels |
|stored as   |object and parameters | arrays of colours |
|editing   | lossless editing | loss due to rasterization (e.g. aliasing) |
|uses   | diagrams | photos |
